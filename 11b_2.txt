hello world this is has been great summer 
am writing this file to show how read system call can be used effeciently
keep on read n bytes until return value is n
once it is less than n bytes, change your len to current ret as we need to read less words
if return value is -1, which means there is some error, so we throw error and get out of the loop
Thank you!
